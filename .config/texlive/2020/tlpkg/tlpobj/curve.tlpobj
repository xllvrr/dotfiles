shortdesc A class for making curriculum vitae
longdesc CurVe is a class for writing a CV, with configuration for the
longdesc language in which you write. The class provides a set of
longdesc commands to create rubrics, entries in these rubrics etc. CurVe
longdesc then format the CV (possibly splitting it onto multiple pages,
longdesc repeating the titles etc), which is usually the most painful
longdesc part of CV writing. Another nice feature of CurVe is its
longdesc ability to manage different CV 'flavours' simultaneously. It is
longdesc often the case that you want to maintain slightly divergent
longdesc versions of your CV at the same time, in order to emphasize on
longdesc different aspects of your background. CurVe also comes with
longdesc support for use with AUC-TeX.
