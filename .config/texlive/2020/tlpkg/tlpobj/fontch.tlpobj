shortdesc Changing fonts, sizes and encodings in Plain TeX
longdesc The fontch macros allow the user to change font size and family
longdesc anywhere in a plain TeX document. Sizes of 8, 10, 12, 14, 20
longdesc and 24 points are available. A sans serif family (\sf) is
longdesc defined in addition to the families already defined in plain
longdesc TeX. Optional support for Latin Modern T1 and TS1 fonts is
longdesc given. There are macros for non-latin1 letters and for most TS1
longdesc symbols. Math mode always uses CM fonts. A command for
longdesc producing doubled-spaced documents is also provided. The
longdesc present version of the package is designed to deal with the
longdesc latest release of the Latin Modern fonts version 1.106.
longdesc Unfortunately, it can no longer support earlier versions of the
longdesc fonts, so an obsolete version of the package is retained for
longdesc users who don't yet have access to the latest version of the
longdesc fonts.
