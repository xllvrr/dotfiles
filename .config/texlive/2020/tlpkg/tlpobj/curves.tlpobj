shortdesc Curves for LaTeX picture environment
longdesc This package draws curves in the standard LaTeX picture
longdesc environment using parabolas between data points with continuous
longdesc slope at joins; for circles and arcs, it uses up to 16
longdesc parabolas. The package can also draw symbols or dash patterns
longdesc along curves. The package provides facilities equivalent to
longdesc technical pens with compasses and French curves. Curves consist
longdesc of short secants drawn by overlapping disks or line-drawing
longdesc \special commands selected by package options.
