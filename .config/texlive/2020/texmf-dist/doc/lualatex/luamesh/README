luamesh package by Maxime Chupin 
Version 0.51 dated 2017/04/15

The LuaLaTeX package luamesh allows to compute and draw 2D Delaunay triangulation.
The algorithm is written with lua, and depending on the choice of the “engine”,
the drawing is done by MetaPost (with luamplib) or by tikz.
The Delaunay triangulation algorithm is the Bowyer and Watson algorithm.
Several macros are provided to draw the global mesh, the set of points, or
a particular step of the algorithm.
