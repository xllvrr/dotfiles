                         -=- FONTOOLS -=-


This package provides tools to simplify using OpenType fonts with LaTeX.

By far the most important program in this bundle is autoinst:

    AUTOINST - a wrapper script around Eddie Kohler's LCDF TypeTools.
        Autoinst aims to automate the installation of OpenType fonts in LaTeX
        by calling the LCDF TypeTools (with the correct options) for all fonts
        you wish to install, and generating the necessary .fd and .sty files.

In addition, this bundle contains a few other, less important utilities:

    AFM2AFM - re-encode .afm files

    OT2KPX - extract kerning pairs from OpenType fonts

    SPLITTTC - split an OpenType Collection file (ttc or otc) into
               individual fonts



PREREQUISITES
=============

Perl

    The Fontools are written in Perl; any remotely recent version should work.
    Perl is usually installed on Linux and Unix systems;
    for Windows, try ActivePerl (http://www.activestate.com)
    or Strawberry Perl (http://strawberryperl.com).

LCDF TypeTools
    Of course, Autoinst needs the LCDF TypeTools;
    they should be installed in a directory on your PATH.

Kpathsea
    Automatically installing the fonts into a suitable TEXMF tree
    (as Autoinst does by default) requires a TeX-installation that uses
    the kpathsea library; with TeX distributions that implement their
    own directory searching (such as MiKTeX), Autoinst will complain that
    it cannot find the kpsewhich program and install all generated files
    into subdirectories of the current directory.

    If you use such a TeX distribution, either move these files to their
    destinations by hand, or use the -target command line option
    (please see the manual for more information).


Installation
------------
When installing manually, the encoding files in the "share/" directory
should be moved to a "standard" location where otftotfm can find them.
What this location is depends on your TeX installation;
in TeXLive, it should be $TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/enc/dvips/fontools/ or,
if you don't have write permissions in $TEXMFLOCAL,
$TEXMFHOME/fonts/enc/dvips/fontools/.

The scripts in the "bin/" directory should be placed in a directory
on your PATH (or else you have to call them with their full path name).

Of course, when using a package manager (such as tlmgr) to do
the installation, all files will automatically be put in the right
location.
