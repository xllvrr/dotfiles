1.1 Overview
============

Epspdftk is a GUI program that converts files between eps, pdf and
general PostScript in any direction.

It lets you interactively select a file, set conversion options, and
save in the same of another format.  A configuration screen offers some
additional conversion options.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Viewing,  Next: Conversion options,  Prev: Overview,  Up: Usage

1.2 Viewing
===========

The View button at the bottom of the screen invokes an external viewer.

Windows and Mac OS: Epspdftk simply tries to use the default Open
command.

Under Linux the PostScript- and pdf viewers are configurable; see *note
The configuration screen::.

The View button is grayed if epspdf thinks that there is no previewer
for the current file.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Conversion options,  Next: Converting,  Prev: Viewing,  Up: Usage

1.3 Conversion options
======================

   * Grayscaling

   * Compute tight boundingbox.  This option is only available if a
     single page is converted.

   * Page selection.  The only possibilities are selecting a single page
     or selecting all pages.  Converting to eps implies selecting a
     single page.

Note.  For general PostScript files, there is no quick way to determine
the number of pages, so the program may not check beforehand whether you
picked an existing page.  If you don't like that, convert the entire
document to pdf first - which will be done behind the scenes anyway.

Specifying options such as grayscaling or page selection may require a
multistep conversion.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Converting,  Next: The configuration screen,  Prev: Conversion options,  Up: Usage

1.4 Converting
==============

The Convert and save... button calls up a file save dialog.  After a
successful conversion, the result becomes the new current file, so you
can judge the result by pressing the View button again - if epspdftk
thinks that there is a suitable viewer.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: The configuration screen,  Prev: Converting,  Up: Usage

1.5 The configuration screen
============================

Epspdftk also has a configuration screen.  The settings here are
preserved between sessions.

1.5.1 Configuring viewers
-------------------------

Under Unix, the preferred PostScript- and pdf viewers can be configured
in this screen.  Epspdf looks for a number of PostScript- and pdf
viewers, from which you can select one, but you can also enter one
manually.

Some viewers require a plugin for eps and PostScript.  The GUI does not
check whether such a plugin is actually installed.

For Windows and Mac OS there is no such configuration option.  Epspdf
will use the program associated with the file type, which can be
configured outside epspdf.

1.5.2 Options for converting to pdf
-----------------------------------

Double-check the setting "Target use" under "Conversion to pdf".
"prepress" is for pdfs which are going to be printed commercially.  The
options prepress, printer and default will try to embed all fonts.
Often, printshops insist on this.

On the other hand, you may prefer "screen" if file size is a concern.
See also the Ghostscript documentation, in particular Use.htm and
VectorDevices.htm.

Specifying anything other than "default" may cause an additional
conversion step and possibly also loss of high-level structure.

As to pdf versions: this is a trade-off between more features for higher
versions and better compatibility for lower versions.  Versions below
1.4 do not support transparency.  Converting a page or graphic with
transparencies to version 1.3 will probably result in the whole page or
graphic getting rasterized.  For prepress use, consult your printshop or
publisher.  Otherwise leave the pdf version at "default".

1.5.3 Options for converting to PostScript
------------------------------------------

For conversion to plain or Encapsulated PostScript, pdftops sometimes
does a better job of preserving fonts than Ghostscript.  Under Windows,
current versions of both MiKTeX and TeX Live include pdftops.  Still,
you may opt not to use pdftops even if it is available, in which case
Ghostscript will be used instead.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Command-line usage,  Next: Notes on PostScript and pdf,  Prev: Usage,  Up: Top

2 Command-line usage
********************

epspdf.tlu is the backend of epspdftk, but it can also be used
standalone.  It shares configuration settings with epspdftk.tcl.

The first parameter of the epspdftk GUI program is interpreted as
startup directory for the file browser.  Epspdf itself has a more
elaborate command-line interface.

Below, we assume that there is a suitable wrapper or symlink for epspdf
on your searchpath.  This is the case if you installed epspdf as a TeX
Live- or MiKTeX package.

Basic usage of epspdf itself:

3 Notes on PostScript and pdf

* Bounding- and other boxes::
* Orientation::
* Exporting PostScript or pdf from Windows programs::


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Bitmapped and vector,  Next: Font embedding,  Prev: Notes on PostScript and pdf,  Up: Notes on PostScript and pdf

3.1 Bitmapped and vector
========================

Pictures can be described either in terms of pixels, or more abstractly,
in terms of geometric shapes, fonts and text.

Bitmapped or pixel-based graphics are appropriate for photographs and
screenshots, but less so for diagrams and spreadsheet-generated
graphics.

A file in PostScript- or pdf format can contain both types of graphic
data.

Vector graphics can be freely scaled without losing sharpness or
becoming pixellated.  If bitmapped graphics are enlarged too much,
individual pixels become apparent.  With low-resolution bitmaps this
happens sooner than with high-resolution bitmaps, but high-resolution
bitmaps have (much) larger file sizes, and take longer to process.

So avoid converting vector to bitmap.  However, converting from bitmap
to vector is also best avoided, since it is very hard to do well.

Epspdf usually avoids conversion from vector to bitmap and never
converts the other way.  With the screen- and ebook "Target use" option,
included bitmaps tend to be downsampled, i.e.  reduced to a lower
resolution.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Font embedding,  Next: Eps preview headers,  Prev: Bitmapped and vector,  Up: Notes on PostScript and pdf

3.2 Font embedding
==================

When converting to pdf, Ghostscript handles font embedding differently
depending on the "Target use" option.  According to the Ghostscript
documentation, it embeds all fonts without exception for all targets
except "screen", for which standard fonts such as Times may be omitted.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Eps preview headers,  Next: Bounding- and other boxes,  Prev: Font embedding,  Up: Notes on PostScript and pdf

3.3 Eps preview headers
=======================

Preview headers are quietly stripped from eps files.  These preview
headers are used by e.g.  desktop-publishing software to represent eps
files on screen without having to interpret the PostScript code itself.
Epspdf has no option to preserve or add them.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Bounding- and other boxes,  Next: Orientation,  Prev: Eps preview headers,  Up: Notes on PostScript and pdf

3.4 Bounding- and other boxes
=============================

A PostScript file may have a page size and a boundingbox defined.  A pdf
file may have a mediabox, a trimbox and various other boxes.
Ghostscript by itself normally converts the PostScript page - which is
anchored at (0,0) - to the pdf mediabox.

Conversion to pdf usually translates the bottom-left corner to the (0,0)
origin and sets the ...box to the size of the graphic.  Anything outside
the ...box should be cut off.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Orientation,  Next: Exporting PostScript or pdf from Windows programs,  Prev: Bounding- and other boxes,  Up: Notes on PostScript and pdf

3.5 Orientation
===============

Ghostscript may not be able to determine the right orientation of a
PostScript- or pdf file.  This may result in part of a graphic being cut
off after conversion or even everything falling outside the page /
mediabox / boundingbox.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Exporting PostScript or pdf from Windows programs,  Prev: Orientation,  Up: Notes on PostScript and pdf

3.6 Exporting PostScript or pdf from Windows programs
=====================================================

Microsoft Office 2010 can now export to pdf, either the entire document
or a selection.  This removes a major headache for Windows users.
Windows 10 also includes a pdf printer.

As a last resort on earlier Windows versions, you can "print" to a
PostScript file.  From some programs, you can print a selection.  A
suitable driver which comes with Windows is Generic / MS Publisher Color
Printer.  Pay attention to the printer properties: choose "Outline" for
font downloading and avoid the "Optimize for speed" setting for
PostScript Output Option.  In my tests, "Encapsulated PostScript" did
not look very promising either.  Try e.g.  "Archive" instead.  These
options can be found under the Advanced button.

4 Bitmapped graphics for LaTeX and pdflatex
*******************************************

pdflatex can use graphics in .png format (best for screenshots) and .jpg
format (best for photographs) directly.  However, for LaTeX you are
stuck with .eps format.  Tips for converting to .eps:

* Linux::
* Mac OS::
* Windows::


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Linux,  Next: Mac OS,  Prev: Bitmapped graphics for LaTeX and pdflatex,  Up: Bitmapped graphics for LaTeX and pdflatex

4.1 Linux
=========

_sam2p_
     This command-line bitmap-to-PostScript/pdf conversion utility is
     available from <http://code.google.com/p/sam2p/> and may already be
     packaged for your distribution.  It produces very small files:
     'sam2p image.png image.eps'
_ImageMagick/convert_
     'convert' from the ImageMagick package is a command-line utility:
     'convert image.png image.eps'
_The GIMP_
     This is the premier open source image editing program.  It is often
     pre-installed on Linux, and is also available for other platforms.
     The GIMP can save in eps- and pdf format.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Mac OS,  Next: Windows,  Prev: Linux,  Up: Bitmapped graphics for LaTeX and pdflatex

4.2 Mac OS
==========

Mac OS's built-in Preview application can read most bitmapped formats
and save them as pdf or PostScript.  In fact, in many cases it is an
excellent alternative to epspdf.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Windows,  Prev: Mac OS,  Up: Bitmapped graphics for LaTeX and pdflatex

4.3 Windows
===========

I know of no built-in facility for converting bitmaps to eps or pdf,
apart from "printing" to PostScript or pdf.  However, many image editors
can convert to eps or pdf.  A couple of command-line utilities:
     sam2p image.png image.eps
or
     bmeps -c image.png image.eps
sam2p is distributed with TeX Live (Windows only), bmeps both with TeX
Live and with MikTeX. Without the '-c' option, bmeps produces a
grayscale image.  It produces larger files than sam2p.

With TeX Live, you can convert to eps by right-clicking an image in
Windows Explorer and "open" with _bitmap2eps_, which uses sam2p or bmeps
in the background.

5.2 Ghostscript stackunderflow error
====================================

Some Ghostscript versions, _e.g._  9.10, have an error in color handling
when converting to pdf: selecting "printer" as target may lead to an
error 'stackunderflow in .setdistillerparams'.  If you run into this,
use the "default" or "prepress" target instead.

5.3 Error message mentioning failure of pdf_crop
================================================

Problably, the luatex format has not been generated.  Fix this with TeX
Live Manager or with the MiKTeX Console.

If the PostScript file was generated with the old Windows PostScript
driver, experiment with the PostScript Output option.  Don't choose
Optimize for Speed.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Fonts look ugly,  Next: The page has been converted to a bitmap,  Prev: Part of the graphic gets cut off,  Up: Troubleshooting

5.6 Fonts look ugly
===================

If Ghostscript has to do the conversion from pdf to ps then text may not
remain text, but may be replaced by bitmaps.  Newer Ghostscript versions
tend to do better in this respect than older ones, but as to preserving
fonts, the pdftops utility may still handle more cases.  It is part of
the xpdf suite and of the Poppler utilities.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: The page has been converted to a bitmap,  Next: Temporary files are not removed,  Prev: Fonts look ugly,  Up: Troubleshooting

5.7 The page has been converted to a bitmap
===========================================

The usual cause is that the page contains features such as transparency
which are not supported by the target format.

Otherwise, set pdf target use and target version both to "default" to
avoid unnecessary conversions: '-T default -N default'


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Temporary files are not removed,  Next: Resources for troubleshooting,  Prev: The page has been converted to a bitmap,  Up: Troubleshooting

5.8 Temporary files are not removed
===================================

   * Command-line: make sure that you did not specify the option '-d'.
   * Epspdftk GUI: make sure that 'Remove temp files' is checked.
   * Windows: this platform is notorious for excessive file locking.  I
     already inserted a Windows-specific delay before attempting to
     delete the temporary files, but this is not always enough.
     However, you should have no trouble removing temporary files
     manually.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Resources for troubleshooting,  Prev: Temporary files are not removed,  Up: Troubleshooting

5.9 Resources for troubleshooting
=================================

Logfile.  The GUI has a button for viewing log output.  This same output
is also written to a file 'epspdf.log'.  For Linux/Unix/Mac Mac OS this
is in a subdirectory .epspdf of your home directory; for Windows it is
in a subdirectory epspdf of '%APPDATA%'.  This APPDATA directory may be
'c:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming'.  Type
     echo %APPDATA%
in a Command Prompt window to find out which.

The logfile lists all epspdf calls and all Ghostscript- and pdftops
calls plus error information.

Temporary files.  The temporary files may give clues as well.  Uncheck
the button "Remove temp files", or for the command-line version, give a
-d parameter to keep the temporary files.  Check the log(file) as to
which temporary files have been created.

Ghostscript- and pdftops documentation.  For Ghostscript, the most
important files are VectorDevices.htm and Use.htm.  For pdftops, type
'pdftops -h'.  For Unix, there is also a man page, and for Windows there
is a file pdftops.txt in the distribution zip.  TeX Live includes the
man page in pdf format: pdftops.pdf.

Appendix A Requirements
***********************

Epspdftk consists of a GUI front end and a command-line back end.

The command-line component, which can be used separately from the front
end, requires ghostscript and a not too old TeX installation with
luatex.  It may further benefit from the presence of pdftops.  MiKTeX
and TeX Live for Windows meet these requirements out of the box.

The front end requires a Tcl/Tk installation, or at least a tclkit
runtime.  TeX Live for Windows contains such a tclkit since late 2018,
and epspdftk as a TeX Live package will make use of it.  The minimum
version is 8.5.

For Windows there is an alternate epspdf-setup package on CTAN with an
embedded Tcl/Tk runtime and a regular Windows installer, which also
creates a menu shortcut and an uninstaller.

File: epspdf.info,  Node: Version 0.6.5,  Next: Version 0.6.4,  Prev: Change history,  Up: Change history

B.1 Version 0.6.5
=================

Epspdf: Compatibility change for ghostscript 9.50 and later.

Epspdftk: improvements to viewer selection; does not impact Windows or
MacOS.

A few updates to the manual, mostly for the troubleshooting section.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Version 0.6.4,  Next: Version 0.6,  Prev: Version 0.6.5,  Up: Change history

B.2 Version 0.6.4
=================

Compatibility changes for luatex 1.9 and later.

The location of pdftops is no longer configurable; it is only searched
for on the searchpath.

Some corner cases should be handled more successfully.

The GUI now requires Tcl/Tk version 8.5 or higher.  On Windows,
epspdf.tlu is now invoked via a batchfile.  This should prevent black
console windows popping up.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Version 0.6,  Next: Version 0.5,  Prev: Version 0.6.4,  Up: Change history

B.3 Version 0.6
===============

The command-line backend component has been rewritten in texlua and
therefore no longer needs an external scripting language.

Grayscaling is now done by Ghostscript's color options for pdf output.
This also works for bitmaps.

Croppping of pdfs is now accomplished by running luatex on a suitable
wrapper file (same method as Heiko Oberdiek's pdfcrop).  Such a
conversion preserves advanced features which might otherwise get lost.

I no longer try to provide an AppleScript wrapper.

The current version has no provisions for custom Ghostscript- or pdftops
parameters.  The corresponding command-line options are accepted but
have no effect.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Version 0.5,  Next: Version 0.4,  Prev: Version 0.6,  Up: Change history

B.4 Version 0.5
===============

The GUI has been rewritten in Tcl/Tk, removing the dependence on the
Ruby/Tk interface library.

The Windows installer now installs a small Ruby subset and the standard
epspdf distribution, but with epspdftk.tcl replaced with a starpack: a
single executable containing 'epspdftk.tcl' and a Tcl/Tk runtime.  See
<http://wiki.tcl.tk/52>.

Epspdf now uses its own subdirectory for both the logfile and the
configuration file.  For Linux/Unix/Mac OS this is '$HOME/.epspdf', for
Windows it is '%APPDATA%\epspdf'.  On all supported platforms, settings
are stored in the file 'config' in this directory.  Under Windows, the
registry is no longer used for this.

A button has been added to view log output.

There is a second new button "Remove temp files", which is normally
checked, causing temporary files to be deleted after each conversion.
Unchecking this button may be useful for troubleshooting.  In previous
versions, temporary files were deleted at the end of the entire epspdftk
session but that has become less practical now that the GUI and epspdf
itself have become two separate programs.

The "Open with..." option for Windows has been dropped for technical
reasons.

The "-version" option now prints the version string instead of setting
the desired pdf version.

The "-info" option now also prints the number of pages for pdf files.


File: epspdf.info,  Node: Version 0.4,  Prev: Version 0.5,  Up: Change history

B.5 Version 0.4
===============

Hi-res boundingboxes are now supported.  By default, conversion from eps
to pdf now uses the hires boundingbox as "page" to determine the page
dimensions of the pdf file.  Other conversions preserve or generate a
hires boundingbox.

Under Windows, the new version looks for an installed TeX and will use
its private Ghostscript if it cannot find a separately installed
Ghostscript.  TeX Live's pdftops, being on the searchpath, will be used
unless epspdf finds another copy first.

There is now a "-v" (lowercase) option to print the version string.
