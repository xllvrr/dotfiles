1 Introduction
**************

This is Fontname, a naming scheme for (the base part of) external TeX
font filenames.  This makes at most eight-character names from (almost)
arbitrarily complex font names, thus helping portability of TeX
documents.  We point out some shortcomings of the scheme, and ways of
dealing with them.

   Please send additions, corrections, or other comments to
<tex-fonts@tug.org>.  Email <tex-fonts-request@tug.org> to join the
list.

   Besides this document, the Fontname distribution includes various
encoding files, mapping files, and utilities.  See the file `README'
for details.  You can retrieve the most up-to-date version of these
lists from `http://tug.org/fontname'.  It is also mirrored on all CTAN
hosts in the directory `tex-archive/doc/fontname'.  For a list of CTAN
mirrors, see `http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/CTAN.sites'.

1.1 History
===========

The original inspiration for Fontname was Frank Mittelbach and Rainer
Schoepf's article in `TUGboat' 11(2) (June 1990), which led to my
article in `TUGboat' 11(4) (November 1990), pages 512-519.  Mittelbach
wrote another article criticizing the scheme below in `TUGboat' 13(1)
(April 1992), pages 51-53; most of his points are well-taken, but I saw
no alternative then, and see no alternative now.  Others of his points
are addressed in the appropriate sections below.

   In August 1995, Fontname version 2 was released, concomitantly with
a new release of the PostScript fonts for use with LaTeX and Dvips.
After several years of experience, several modifications of the original
distribution seemed desirable: more precise specification of encodings
(*note Variants::); machine-readable mapping files (the `*.map' files
in the distribution) and standardizing directory names as well as font
filenames (included in `supplier.map' and `typeface.map').

   In Fontname version 1, some encoding variant characters (`0', `2',
etc.) have been reassigned to a `7' or `8' sequence (*note Variants::).
Although this is an incompatible change, the advantages of (1)
consistency in naming encoding variants, and (2) having some free
variants makes it worthwhile.  Also, not so coincidentally, new metrics
for PostScript fonts in the Cork encoding were issued--same encoding,
different metrics. So a new name served a practical purpose as well.

   Many people have contributed to this work.  In particular, I
gratefully acknowledge Nelson Beebe, Barbara Beeton, Rocky Bernstein,
Thierry Bouche, Damian Cugley, Berthold K.P. Horn, Alan Jeffrey,
Russell Lang, Pierre MacKay, Sebastian Rahtz, Jean Rivlin, and Tom
Rokicki.

1.2 References
==============

Related files and distributions:

   * The TeX Directory Structure (TDS) standard, available at
     (`http://tug.org/tds' and `CTAN:/tds') specifies a directory tree
     for all TeX library files.  The directory names given in *note
     Suppliers:: and *note Typefaces:: are intended to mesh with that
     standard.

   * The `modes.mf' file (`ftp://tug.org/tex/modes.mf') contains
     recommended mode names to use as directory names.

   * The Fontinst distribution (`http://tug.org/applications/fontinst'
     supports quite general creation of virtual fonts, named according
     to the scheme given here.

   * The Dvips translator (`http://tug.org/dvips') supports resident
     and downloadable PostScript fonts.  Dvips was the first place where
     Fontname became widely known.  Dvips also includes Afm2tfm, another
     program that can create virtual fonts.

   * The Dviljk processor (included in TeX Live) contains TeX support
     for the fonts built into the LaserJet 4.

2 Filenames for fonts
*********************

In this scheme, names may consist of only the letters (monocase a-z),
numerals (0-9), and underscore.  Having two names which differ only in
case is undesirable, since it results in clashes on common Windows
filesystems.

   Here is the basic scheme (the spaces here are merely for
readability):

      S TT W [V...] [N] [E] [DD]

where

S
     represents the supplier of the font.

TT
     represents the typeface name.

W
     represents the weight.

V...
     represents the variant(s), and is omitted if both it and the width
     are normal.  Many fonts have more than one variant.

N
     represents the encoding, and is omitted if the encoding is
     nonstandard.  Encodings are subsumed in the section on variants
     (*note Variants::).

E
     represents the width ("expansion"), and is omitted if it is normal.

DD
     represents the design size (in decimal), and is omitted if the
     font is linearly scaled.  Mittelbach in `TUGboat' 13(1) proposes
     using hexadecimal or base-36 notation.  In my opinion, the
     increased range does not make up for the unreadability of the
     common sizes (e.g., 10pt fonts would have a suffix `a' (in hex),
     or `j' (in base 36)).


   We used to try to limit font names to eight characters.  This was
never completely possible, and since DOS filesystems have become rare,
it's no longer an issue.

   The weight, variants, and width are probably all best taken from the
original name of the font, instead of trying to relate them to some
external standard.

2.1 Suppliers
=============

The "supplier" is the source of a font, typically a (digital) type
foundry.

   You should use the supplier letter which matches the supplier you
obtained the font from, not the original source; for example, Avant
Garde was designed by Herb Lubalin for ITC, but Adobe also sells it.
The name of the font that you get from Adobe should start with `p'.
This is because font resellers typically make modifications to the
original design.

   Notes on specific suppliers:

`f'
     For fonts that are distributed without any specific attribution to
     the creator, by individuals, or by small foundries.
     (Unfortunately, we don't have enough characters to assign one to
     every font supplier in the world.)

`r'
     obsolete; specifies raw fonts, in the old distribution of Dvips.
     New fonts should never use `r'. (The right thing to do is specify
     the correct encoding, variant, or whatever the font's
     characteristics actually are.)

`z'
     for fonts that just don't fit well into the naming scheme.  The `z'
     should be followed by the real supplier letter.

   Here is the table from the file `supplier.map'.  It is organized
alphabetically by abbreviation.  Each line consists of an abbreviation,
directory name, and comment.

2.2 Typefaces
=============

For our purposes, a "typeface" is a collection of related fonts.

   We sometimes use the same typeface abbreviation for fonts with
different supplier names, where we know (usually by inspection) that
the fonts truly are the same.  This helps conserve abbreviations.

   Notes on specific typefaces:

`ad'
`gm'
     To explain a common confusion: `ad' is Adobe Garamond (with a
     `FontName' of `AGaramond'). This is quite different from the
     `Garamond' typeface distributed by Adobe, which is actually ITC
     Garamond.  (Garamond No. 3 (`f3'), Simoncini Garamond (`ig'), and
     Stempel Garamond (`eg') are still other variations on the Garamond
     theme.)

`lh'
`ls'
`lx'
`r1'
     These abbreviations for Lucida typeface subfamilies, et al., solve
     a problem with names getting too long, or help conserve variant
     abbreviations.  *Note Variants::.  Ideally, they would not exist.

`ns'
`nt'
`tm'
     Suppliers offer as many variations on the Times New Roman design
     as they do Garamond.  Adobe has `Times', `TimesNewRoman', and
     `TimesNewRomanPS'.  Although this last has been used by other
     foundries (e.g., Monotype) for a Times variation exactly
     compatible with Adobe's `Times', Adobe itself also offers it, so
     we must have abbreviations for all three.

`pi'
     For pi fonts. Since names of pi fonts are rather arbitrary, it is
     not useful to try to assign typeface abbreviations to all of them.
     Instead, we use the supplier letter, `pi', an arbitarily-assigned
     three-digit number, a weight and (if necessary) a variant. For
     example, `mpi001r'.  Pi font `001' for one supplier has nothing to
     do with pi font `001' for another.

   Here is the table, from the file `typeface.map'.  It is organized
alphabetically by abbreviation.  Each line consists of an abbreviation
and directory name, possibly followed by PostScript `FontName's and/or
a comment in roman.  The `FontName' may be preceded by a letter S and a
`:', as in `b:Dutch'.  In that case, the S is a supplier abbreviation,
and we've used that abbreviation for the given `FontName' from that
supplier.

2.3 Weights
===========

The "weight" of a font specifies its boldness.  Arranged from lightest
to heaviest (more or less):

     hairline, extra light, light
     book, regular, medium
     demibold, semibold, bold, extra bold, heavy
     black, ultra, poster

   Here is the table, from the file `weight.map'.  It is organized
alphabetically by abbreviation.  Each line consists of an abbreviation
and any parts of a PostScript `FontName' which use that abbreviation.

     a Thin Hairline
     b Bold
     c Black
     d Demi
     h Heavy Heavyface
     j ExtraLight
     k Book
     l Light
     m Medium
     p Poster
     r Regular Roman
     s Semibold
     u Ultra UltraBlack
     x ExtraBold ExtraBlack

2.4 Variants
============

"Variants" include typeface variations (e.g., italic, sans serif), and
font encodings (e.g., Adobe standard, TeX text).

   A fontname may require multiple variants.  To resolve the worst
ambiguities, we specify that any encoding variant (`7', `8', or `9',
see below) come last and any other numeral variant come first (to avoid
confusion with a design size).  We recommend but do not require that
the other variants be given in alphabetical order.  (It's not required
because it's too painful to implement the sorting in TeX, and many
existing names already have non-alphabetized variants.)

   The letterspacing possibilities introduced by `fontinst' and virtual
fonts have not yet become sufficiently widespread to make
standardization beneficial.  Likewise for the many possible ways to
generate small caps fonts.

   Notes on specific variants, both old and new:

`1'
`4'
`6'
`b'
     These variants (`semisans', `bright', `semiserif', and `fax') were
     used only for single typefaces, so to conserve variant
     abbreviations, they now have typeface abbreviations instead.
     Also, for `b', to avoid too-long names; and for the others, to
     avoid variant vs. design-size ambiguities.

`g'
`h'
     Since these variants were not actually used in any font names,
     they are now obsolete and may be reassigned in the future.

`5'
`6'
`7'
`8'
`9'
     These characters begin a two-character "encoding variant".
     Generally, `7' is for 7-bit encodings, `8' is for 8-bit encodings,
     and `9' is for expertised encodings with or without oldstyle
     digits (see the `x' item below), but this is not an absolute rule.
     Also, `5' is presently used for phonetic encodings and `6' for
     Cyrillic encodings.  The `9s' (`SuperFont') variant contain all of
     Adobe, Latin 1, and Expert glyphs, perhaps with slightly different
     metrics than the original fonts.

     For a font to be named with a certain encoding variant, it's not
     necessary that all the characters appear in precisely the same
     positions as in the encoding definition.  It's enough that the
     usual TeX macros work. In practice, this means that it's ok for a
     font to be labelled `7t' if the only difference from Computer
     Modern is that the ligatures and the `lslash' and `Lslash'
     characters are different, since it's impossible to access or
     change the ligature table from TeX.  Standard PostScript fonts
     don't have an `lslash' character the way Computer Modern does, but
     they do have the `Lslash' and `lslash' characters themselves, so
     the usual TeX `\lslash' and `\Lslash' macros can be made to work
     via ligatures.  See the file `T1.etx' file in the `fontinst'
     distribution for details.

     If a name does not contain a specific encoding variant, its
     encoding is unspecified.  For example, some of the fonts
     distributed with Dvips(k) have names like `ptmr' for
     `Times-Roman'; they use the Dvips encoding (*note dvips::), which
     is close to (but not the same as) the TeX text encoding (as in
     Computer Modern Roman).  Similarly, the TFM files distributed with
     Dvilj(k) for the builtin LaserJet 4 fonts have names like `cunm',
     since these fonts, while compatible with TeX text, contain many
     additional characters.

`9'
     These items are needed only because `x' (and possibly `j')
     followed by a two-character regular variant makes some names too
     long.  That is, `9t' is equivalent in meaning to `x7t', and `9d'
     is equivalent to `jx7t'.  (This may not be true for all `9X'
     encodings, though.)

`k'
`z'
     These variants (indicating Greek and Cyrillic fonts, respectively)
     are obsolete; future fonts in different scripts should be assigned
     an appropriate encoding abbreviation.  These are not currently
     standardized, due to ignorance of the appropriate encodings.
     Please send suggestions for abbreviations to the address in *note
     Introduction::.

`m'
`v'
`y'
     These math-related variants remain for the sake of
     typeface-specific math encodings, e.g., Lucida.  Fonts that use
     the Computer Modern math encodings should use `7m' (*note
     texmital::), `7v' (*note texmext::), and `7y' (*note texmsym::).

`n'
     This is used for several different (but very rare) variants: only
     the Stone typeface has an "informal" variant, and only a few
     Monotype fonts have a "schoolbook" variant, with different `a',
     `g', and `y' shapes.

`r'
     Included only if no other variants, including encodings, apply, and
     either the width (*note Widths::) is not `r' or a design size is
     present.  I.e., `r' is only used as a placeholder.  When the normal
     version of the typeface is sans serif (e.g., Helvetica), `r' should
     be used when necessary, not `s'.  Use `s' only when the typeface
     family has both serif and sans serif variants.

`s'
`t'
     Mittelbach in `TUGboat' 13(1) suggests that these variants (for
     `sans' and `typewriter') should be identified as part of the
     typeface name, because there are few typeface families with these
     variants.  I feel that since they are logically variants, it's
     best to name them that way.  But `LucidaSans' (*note Typefaces::)
     and a few others are exceptions, to avoid too-long names.

`x'
`8x'
`9?'
     `8x' indicates a font in the `Expert' encoding itself.  `x'
     indicates an "expertised" font, i.e., a composite (virtual) font
     that includes characters from an `8x' font.  And in fact an `xEE'
     sequence is replaced by `9E', to save characters.

   Fontname 1 assignments are shown in brackets in the following table,
from the file `variant.map'.  It is organized alphabetically by
abbreviation.  Each line consists of an abbreviation and either any
parts of a PostScript `FontName' which use that abbreviation or the
PostScript `Encoding' name.

2.5 Widths
==========

The "width" of a font specifies the compression or expansion of the
font.  Arranged from narrowest to widest (more or less):

     ultra compressed, extra condensed, compressed, condensed, narrow
     regular
     semiextended, extended, expanded, wide

   Expansion or compression of fonts is sometimes done automatically
(as by the PostScript `scale' operator), and sometimes done by humans.
In the latter case, the human will also presumably choose a font name
which includes `Extended' or `Expanded' or `Condensed' or `Narrow' or
whatever according to their own preferences; the abbreviation can
follow along.  When creating a new synthetically expanded or compressed
font for use with TeX, e.g., with Afm2tfm or `fontinst', use `n' and
`e'.

   Here is the table, from the file `width.map'.  It is organized
alphabetically by abbreviation.  Each line consists of an abbreviation
and any parts of a PostScript `FontName' which use that abbreviation.

     c Condensed Cond
     e Expanded
     n Narrow Semicondensed
     o UltraCondensed
     p Compressed Compact
     q ExtraCompressed ExtraCondensed
     r Normal Medium Regular (usually omitted)
     t Thin
     u UltraCompressed
     v ExtraExpanded more than Expanded, less than Wide
     w Wide
     x Extended Elongated
     y Semiexpanded

3 Long names
************

Eight characters is not enough to unambiguously represent all fonts.  To
do that, we have to allow ourselves arbitrarily long names.  Although we
certainly cannot use such names for the files themselves, we could still
use them in TeX documents given a simple mapping file, as discussed
below.

* Menu:

* Name mapping file::           Aliases for fonts.
* Long naming scheme::          A way to use more than 8 alphanumerics.


File: fontname.info,  Node: Name mapping file,  Next: Long naming scheme,  Up: Long names

3.1 A fontname mapping file
===========================

At the moment, most implementations of TeX look up a TFM file (as part
of the `\font' command), by searching for a file with the name given by
the user (possibly in any of series of directories).  But if we also
looked TFM names up in _another_ file (or set of files), which
specifies the actual filename, the fontname given in the TeX source
file could be almost anything at all, of any length.

   In version 5.851d of Web2c, I implemented this mapping file.  Each
file `texfonts.map' in a search path is read for abbreviations. The file
has a straightforward format: each line specifies the filename and the
TeX name for one font, separated by whitespace.  Extra information on
the line is ignored; then more information could be specified for the
benefit of DVI-reading programs in the same file.  Comments start with
`%' and continue to the end of the line.

   Besides allowing long names, this sort of mapping file has other
benefits.  TeX source or DVI files can be more easily transported,
because the font names in a particular file can be made to work on every
system.  Also, when combined with a consistent naming scheme, macros
could be written to access any of a number of fonts.  Right now, each
font family has to have specialized macros written to deal with it.

   Incidentally, Professor Knuth has approved this as a legitimate
"system-dependent" extension; a TeX with such a feature can still be
called "TeX".

3.2 A naming scheme for long names
==================================

Once we allow ourselves long names, we can construct a naming scheme to
handle arbitrary fonts without much difficulty.  Here is one proposal,
based on the X Window System font naming conventions.

     SUPPLIER-FAMILY-WEIGHT-VARIANTS-WIDTH-ENCODING--SIZE

   SUPPLIER is the usual `Adobe', `Autologic', etc., as well as
`unknown' or `bizarre'--this last meaning the rest of the name is
nonstandard.  If the SUPPLIER is missing, i.e., the name starts with a
`-', "public domain" is assumed.  For fonts made by individuals, the
initials of the designer would probably make a good SUPPLIER.

   FAMILY is `ComputerModern' or `Times' or whatever.

   Everything else is optional.  The `--' before the SIZE lets one
specify a name with, say, a weight and variants, but then skip the
WIDTH and ENCODING, but still be able to give a size.

   WEIGHT and WIDTH are as described earlier.

   If there is more than one variant, they are separated with some
character other than `-', say `=':
     B+H-Lucida-Bold-Sans=Typewriter--10

   ENCODING is what Metafont calls the `font_coding_scheme'--the layout
of the characters in the font.  For example, `Cork' or `ISOLatin1' or
`AdobeAlternate'.

   Names are case-sensitive, for consistency with the rest of TeX and
with PostScript, etc.  Spaces cannot be used in the name, to make it
easier for TeX to parse.  Likewise, characters with default category
codes other than 11 (letter) or 12 (other) should not be used.

   Another possibility is to forget all the above, and simply use the
vendor's name (perhaps prefixed by the vendor): `Times-Roman'.

A.9 URW fonts
=============

Information graciously supplied through URW, via Vincent Ertner: Each
URW font has an assigned font number.  The last character describes the
size or purpose of the font, as the design of the font is optimized
accordingly:

`X000000E'
     Extreme: 8pt and smaller

`X000000T'
     Text: between 8 and 18pt

`X000000D'
     Display: 18pt and larger

`X000000P'
     Poster: 48pt and larger

`X000000M'
     Monospaced / Typewriter

`X000000L'
     LaserWriter / PostScript / Adobe compatible

`X000000I'
     Intellifont PCL (5) compatible

   An `F' identifier is not known.

   The `urw.map' file has abbreviations for URW fonts.

Appendix B Encodings
********************

The following sections define various encodings as PostScript encoding
vectors.  These files can be installed in the Dvips header directory and
then used in `psfonts.map' to change font encodings of downloadable or
builtin fonts (*note psfonts.map: (dvips)psfonts.map.).

   You can also specify these `.enc' files to Afm2tfm when building a
font (*note Changing font encodings: (dvips)Changing font encodings.).

   For a discussion of TeX font encodings in general, and defining new
ones for use with `fontinst' in particular, see
`http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/fontinst/doc/encspecs'.

   A tutorial on character code issues in general is available at
`http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/chars.html'.

   Naming specific characters is a tangled and difficult area.  Here are
some links to character tables for Unicode, Adobe, and WGL4, for your
researching pleasure (thanks to Boguslaw Jackowski for the list):

B.3 `8r.enc': TeX base encoding
===============================

% File 8r.enc  TeX Base 1 Encoding  Revision 2.0  2002-10-30
%
% @@psencodingfile@{
%   author    = "S. Rahtz, P. MacKay, Alan Jeffrey, B. Horn, K. Berry,

% @}
%
% The idea is to have all the characters normally included in Type 1 fonts
% available for typesetting. This is effectively the characters in Adobe
% Standard encoding, ISO Latin 1, Windows ANSI including the euro symbol,
% MacRoman, and some extra characters from Lucida.
%
% Character code assignments were made as follows:
%
% (1) the Windows ANSI characters are almost all in their Windows ANSI
% positions, because some Windows users cannot easily reencode the
% fonts, and it makes no difference on other systems. The only Windows
% ANSI characters not available are those that make no sense for
% typesetting -- rubout (127 decimal), nobreakspace (160), softhyphen
% (173). quotesingle and grave are moved just because it's such an
% irritation not having them in TeX positions.
%
% (2) Remaining characters are assigned arbitrarily to the lower part
% of the range, avoiding 0, 10 and 13 in case we meet dumb software.
%
% (3) Y&Y Lucida Bright includes some extra text characters; in the
% hopes that other PostScript fonts, perhaps created for public
% consumption, will include them, they are included starting at 0x12.
% These are /dotlessj /ff /ffi /ffl.
%
% (4) hyphen appears twice for compatibility with both ASCII and Windows.
%
% (5) /Euro was assigned to 128, as in Windows ANSI
%
% (6) Missing characters from MacRoman encoding incorporated as follows:
%
%     PostScript      MacRoman        TeXBase1

%
% This is almost the default encoding produced by the afm2tfm program
% that comes with the dvips distribution, when it is applied to a
% StandardEncoding PostScript font.  The positions of the accented
% characters (which afm2tfm assigned more or less randomly in the
% previous set of fonts) have been held fixed.
%
% It is almost upward-compatible with TeX text.  (The primary exceptions
% are dotaccent and hungarumlaut.)  Some of the ligatures are also in
% different positions, but this is not important, since ligature
% positions are defined in the TFM file, not by macros.
%
% The character positions were assigned in this order:
%   1) non-composite characters in the afm2tfm encoding (except dotlessj
%      was included in its plain TeX position);
%   2) available characters in the Cork (EC) encoding;
%   3) remaining composite characters in the base encoding (starting at
%      position 130 decimal).  We don't include all the other base
%      characters because that changes the height/depth/width tables in

B.5 `ec.enc': Cork encoding

% @}
%
% The original paper can be found on
%    https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb11-4/tb30ferguson.pdf
%
% Names of the glyphs try to comply with:
%    Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts, ver. 1.6, 30 Januaury 2006
%    http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/aglfn13.txt
% but some exceptions are listed below.
%
% The following characters are not present in Unicode:
% - /perthousandzero = used to compose /perthousand, /pertenthousand, ... out of /percent + this character
% -  Germandbls      = now there is a related character in Unicode,
%                      U+1E9E - LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S
%                      but probably /S_S ligature name should be used instead
%
% The following two characters have different Unicode mappings than on the AGL:
% - /tcedilla     = U+0163 - LATIN SMALL LETTER T WITH CEDILLA
%                   according to AGL it should be /tcommaaccent
% - /Tcedilla     = U+0162 - LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T WITH CEDILLA
%                   according to AGL it should be /Tcommaaccent
% But having /scedilla and /tcommaaccent mixed is even more ugly.
%
% The following characters are not present on the AGL:
% - /dotlessj     = U+0237 - LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS J
% - /cwm          = U+200B - ZERO WIDTH SPACE
% - /visiblespace = U+2423 - OPEN BOX
% and should probably better be labeled with uniXXXX notation
% (though hardly any font has those glyphs anyway).
%
% The following ligatures are deprecated by recent AGL:
% - /ff, /fi, /fl, /ffi, /ffl = /f_i and similar should have been used instead
%
% Hyphen character:
% There are two character named "hyphen". The original article explains
% the background of this decision (if one wanted to use a different
% hyphenation character and still be able to use the dash). So the first
% character should serve as "hyphen char" and the other one as "dash" in
% compound words.  The character 0x2D is supposed to be the hyphen char,
% but since there used to be two characters of the same name in this
% file for some time, the tools like afmtotfm have been confused and
% remapped the hyphen char to 0x7F automatically.  After the second
% character's name was changed, hyphenation characters in existing
% tfm fonts (generated with the old ec.enc) have disappeared, so the
% second character has been renamed back to "hyphen". Anyone generating
% tfm fonts is strongly encouraged to make a copy of this file, rename
% it and change glyph names as required for their font.
%
% Other remarks:
% - /Eth = U+00D0 - LATIN CAPITAL LETTER ETH
%          must also be used as /Dcroat
%          U+0110 - LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH STROKE
%
% Misleading names and shapes of letters (that lead to different names in past)
% - /lcaron = U+013E - LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH CARON
%             /lquoteright
% - /Lcaron = U+013D - LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L WITH CARON
%             /Lquoteright
% - /dcaron = U+010F - LATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH CARON
%             /dquoteright
% - /tcaron = U+0165 - LATIN SMALL LETTER T WITH CARON
%             /tquoteright
% - /dcroat = U+0111 - LATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH STROKE
%             /dbar, /dmacron

%
%
% Turkish & Romanian
% --------------------
% EC encoding has been defined to include /tcedilla and /scedilla.
% For Turkish one needs /scedilla, while for Romanian one would need
% "t with comma below" (/tcommaaccent) and "s with comma below" (/scommaaccent).
% "t with cedilla" in not used in any language except in inferior
% Romanian typography that can use cedillas instead of commas below.
% AGL has a strange mapping as well.
%
% Without adding an additional character, it is impossible to support both
% languages at the same time, so EC is not really best choice for Romanians,
% even though it can be "misused" if one replaces both /scedilla and /tcedilla
% with /scommaaccent and /tcommaaccent.
%
% Characters that have been renamed in July 2008:
%    0x18        /zeroinferior -> /perthousandzero
%    0x20 U+2423 /visualspace  -> /visiblespace (if font doesn't have it, use /space)

%
%
% This is LaTeX T5 encoding for Vietnamese
%
% history:
%   version 1.0 (28-Jan-2000):
%     First version.
%
%   version 1.1 (29-Apr-2002):
%     Rewritten to make it AGL compliant.
%
%   version 1.2 (01-May-2002):
%     Use uni2423 instead uni2420.
%
%   version 1.3 (27-Sep-2002):
%     . Changed the following glyph names to Unicode entities:
%         0xB3  uni1EBD  etilde
%         0x93  uni1EBC  Etilde
%     . Ytilde (uni1EF8) was used in slot for ytilde (uni1EF9).
%     . Using .notdef in slot for compound word mark (on position 0x17)
%       caused some problems so it was changed to cwm (for compatibilty
%       with ec.enc).
%     . Use sfthyphen in slot 127 instead of hyphen.
%
%   version 1.4 (20-Apr-2005):
%     Add copyright.
%     Minor documentation updates.
%
% LIGKERN hyphen hyphen =: endash ;
% LIGKERN endash hyphen =: emdash ;
% LIGKERN quoteleft quoteleft =: quotedblleft ;
% LIGKERN quoteright quoteright =: quotedblright ;
% LIGKERN comma comma =: quotedblbase ;
%
%   We blow away kerns to and from spaces (TeX doesn't have a
%   space) and also remove any kerns from the numbers.
%
% LIGKERN space {} * ; * {} space ;
% LIGKERN zero {} * ; * {} zero ;
% LIGKERN one {} * ; * {} one ;

% LIGKERN seven {} * ; * {} seven ;
% LIGKERN eight {} * ; * {} eight ;
% LIGKERN nine {} * ; * {} nine ;
%
%
% Some notes on the glyph names:
%
% . We follow the Adobe Glyph List (AGL), also using its associated
%   algorithm.
%
% . The glyphs `spacing dot below' (on position 0x05), `spacing hook above'
%   (on position 0x0C), and `compound word mark' (on position 0x17) are not
%   in Unicode.  We call them `dotbelow', `hookabove', and `cwm',
%   respectively.
%
% . The following glyphs have no special name in the AGL (or names which
%   should not be used in general) and are thus represented as a Unicode
%   entity:
%
%     0x1A  uni1EF6  Y hook above

From GUST.

% =========================================================================
                         QX LAYOUT ver. 0.06
% =========================================================================
Release date: 24 August 2003
Original URL: ftp://bop.eps.gda.pl/pub/qx/
E-mail: JNSteam at gust.org.pl

QX Layout is, actually, a pair of encodings: one for TeX and one for GUI
systems. QX layout has been worked out by the Polish TeX Users Group GUST as
a difficult compromise between needs and abilities. The character set of the
QX layout is expected to suffice for the typesetting of texts (using TeX) in
most of European languages.

QX Encoding for TeX is based on EC (Cork Encoding) with a few characters
exchanged. E.g., gbreve, Gbreve, uring, and Uring, which can be obtained by
superimposing of an accent, are replaced by Lithuanian iogonek, Iogonek,
uogonek, and Uogonek, respectively, which should not be assembled form
separate elements; QX Encoding for GUI systems is a variant of the Code Page
1250 (and also includes Lithuanian characters with ogonek).

After a long debate, we decided (in ver. 0.04 of the QX layout) to replace
omnipresent but actually nonexistent [tT]cedilla by Romanian [tT]commaaccent;
censequently, Turkish [sS]cedilla was replaced by [sS]commaaccent (still we
would recommend to keep the glyph of a [sS]cedilla character in a font).

Under the pressure from euro currency funs, we included moreover an
Euro symbol (in ver. 0.05 of the QX layout). We assigned the slot
128 for it complying with Microsoft proposal for non-cyrillic fonts
(http://www.microsoft.com/typography/faq/faq12.htm):

  The symbol has been added to the following codepages at position
  '0x80'; 1250 Eastern European, 1252 Western, 1253 Greek, 1254 Turkish,
  1257 Baltic, 1255 Hebrew, 1256 Arabic, 1258 Vietnamese, 874 Thai.
  In 1251 Cyrillic the symbol will be added at position '0x88'.

Therefore, we had to do something with a Lithuanian Iogonek character that
previously had occupied this slot. We decided to remove Thorn (222, Tcedilla
in CP 1250) and thorn (254, tcedilla in CP 1250) characters from the Windows
QX layout (we recommend, as with [sS]cedilla characters, to keep the glyphs
in a font) and use the freed slots for Iogonek (previously 128) and iogonek
(previously 144, now free), respectively. The TeX QX layout, fortunately, had
had the slot 128 already free, hence there was no need for rearrangement.

Finally, we decided to change the name of a (non-standard) ligature
fk to f_k, complying with Adobe recommendations contained in:
http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/typeforum/unicodegn.html

Most recent change (24.08.2003, ver. 0.06) was the extension of
the character set by ligatures ij, IJ (available only in the TeX
encoding) and a punctuation mark threequartersemdash.

Below you'll find the comparison of basic layouts for TeX and GUI systems
with QX ver. 0.06.

B.12 `texnansi.enc'
===================

From Y&Y.

% @psencodingfile{
%   date = "22apr09",
%   filename = "texnansi.enc",
%   email = "tex-fonts@tug.org",
%   author = "Y&Y, Inc.",
%   version = "1.1",
%   codetable = "ISO/ASCII",
%   docstring = "texnansi (aka LY1) encoding vector for Type 1 fonts to
%                be used with TeX, following ASCII and Windows ANSI."
% }
%
% The idea is to have all 228 characters normally included in Type 1 text
% fonts (plus a few more) available for typesetting.  This is effectively
% the character set in Adobe Standard Encoding, ISO Latin 1, plus a few more.
%
% Character code assignments were made as follows:
%
% (1) The character layout largely matches `ASCII' in the 32 -- 126 range,
% except for `circumflex' in 94 and `tilde' in 126, to match `TeX text'
% (`asciicircumflex' and `asciitilde' appear in 158 and 142 instead).
%
% (2) The character layout matches `Windows ANSI' in almost all places,
% except for `quoteright' in 39 and `quoteleft' in 96 to match ASCII
% (`quotesingle' and `grave' appear in 129 and 18 instead).
%
% (3) The character layout matches `TeX typewriter' used by CM text fonts
% in most places (except for discordant positions such as hungarumlaut
% (instead of braceright), dotaccent (instead of underscore) etc.
%
% (4) Remaining characters are assigned arbitrarily to the `control character'
% range (0 -- 31), avoiding 0, 9, 10 and 13 in case we meet dumb software
% - similarly one should really avoid 127 and 128 if possible.
% In addition, the 8 open slots in Windows ANSI between 128 and 159 are used.
%
% (5) Y&Y Lucida Bright includes some extra ligatures and such; ff, ffi, ffl,
% and `dotlessj,' these are included 11 -- 15, and 17.
%
% (6) Hyphen appears both at 45 and 173 for compatibility with both ASCII
% and Windows ANSI.
%
% (7) It doesn't really matter where ligatures appear (both real, such as ffi,
% and pseudo such as ---) since these should not be accessed directly, only
% via ligature information in the TFM file.
%
% SAMPLE USAGE (in `psfonts.map' file for DVIPS):
%
% lbr LucidaBright "TeXnANSIEncoding ReEncodeFont" <texnansi.enc <lbr.pfb
%
% This tells DVIPS that the font called `lbr' in TeX has PostScript
% FontName `LucidaBright.'  It also asks DVIPS to expand the file `lbr.pfb'
% into PFA form, to include the attached `texnansi.enc' encoding vector,
% and to then actually reencode the font based on that encoding vector.
