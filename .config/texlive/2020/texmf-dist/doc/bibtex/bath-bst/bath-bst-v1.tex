\section{Introduction}


The data model offered by the standard Bib\TeX\ styles, and even the extended
\textsf{natbib} variants, is not really rich enough to support the nuances of
the Harvard (Bath) style. This means design decisions have to be made about
whether to attempt some level of compatibility with other styles or craft
something utterly unique.

In the first version of \textsf{bath-bst}, the intention was to set things up
so that, if the same \texttt{.bib} file was used with a different style, the features
peculiar to the Harvard (Bath) style would be ignored and the remaining
information would come out in a sensible arrangement. The recommendations of
the style's documentation were to use the standard entry types as much as
possible (though more semantic aliases were provided), and minimal new fields
were introduced. For the more exotic (in Bib\TeX\ terms) demands of the style,
extensive use was made of the (standard) \texttt{note} and (non-standard)
\texttt{titleaddon} fields to place information properly. If you have written
a \texttt{.bib} file according the principles in that first version, the \texttt{bath}
style will still work as advertised for you.

The second version introduced a new variant, \texttt{bathx} (`Bath extended'),
which has a different aim. The idea with this one is that \texttt{.bib} files written
for this style will be rendered just the same by the companion
\textsf{biblatex-bath} style. Where possible, features from the latter have
been emulated for Bib\TeX; otherwise, the `cheats' used in this style will
also work under \textsf{biblatex}.

Happily, it has been possible to do this while keeping most of the code in
common. The main differences between two versions are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In \texttt{bath}, the \texttt{titleaddon} field is printed bare, while
  in \texttt{bathx} it is wrapped in square brackets.
\item
  In \texttt{bathx} online items are marked with `[Online]' automatically,
  while in \texttt{bath} you have to mark them thus yourself.
\item
  In \texttt{bathx} undated items are marked with `n.d.' automatically,
  while in \texttt{bath} you have to give `n.d.' as the value of \texttt{year}
  yourself.
\end{itemize}

One other change worth noting regards URL access dates. In version 1, the
advice was to put them in \texttt{urldate}. With version 2 the advice is now
to put them, perhaps counter-intuitively, in \texttt{urlyear}. The reason is that
\textsf{biblatex} will complain if the value of \texttt{urldate} is in the wrong
format, but will happily print the contents of \texttt{urlyear} literally. If
you don't care about \textsf{biblatex} compatibility, you can continue to use
\texttt{urldate}.

This document provides a suite of examples that demonstrate and test the
bibliography format that was recommended for version 1.0 of the style.

\section{Using the style}

To use the style, add these lines to your preamble:

\begin{tcblisting}{listing only}
\usepackage{natbib}
\newcommand*{\urlprefix}{Available from: }
\newcommand*{\urldateprefix}{Accessed }
\bibliographystyle{bath}
\end{tcblisting}

Remember also to specify your \texttt{.bib} file at the end of the document:

\begin{tcblisting}{listing only}
\bibliography{file}
\end{tcblisting}

To make a citation in the text, use the key that corresponds to the entry in your \texttt{.bib} file:

\begin{tcblisting}{}
While collections can be supplemented by other means \citep{williams1997edd},
the absence of an invisible collection amongst historians is noted by
\citet[p.556]{stieg1981inh}. It may be, as \citet{burchard1965hhl} points out,
that they have no assistants or are reluctant to delegate, or it may be
down to economic factors \citep{adams2009tc1, adams2014tc2, gb.pa2014,
adams2017tc3}\dots
\end{tcblisting}

Please refer to the documentation for \href{http://www.ctan.org/pkg/natbib}{\textsf{natbib}}
for the full range of commands available for in-text citations. Be aware that the
\textsf{natbib} option \texttt{sort} will sort citations in bibliography order,
rather than the chronological order demanded by Harvard (Bath) -- so don't use it!

\subsection{Migrating from version 2 to version 3}

If you have previously used version 2 of the style, you may need to update your
.bib file to accommodate the following changes in version 3:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Journal titles are now coerced to sentence case, so any capital letters you
  want to keep need to be protected with braces.
\item
  Entries of type \texttt{unpublished} are now marked as unpublished. If you
  have been using this for an item that should not be marked as unpublished
  (e.g.~archive photographs, law reports), you can use \texttt{booklet} instead:
  this is the other entry type (along with \texttt{misc}) that has a
  \texttt{howpublished} field instead of a \texttt{publisher}.
  Other entry types may work as well; indeed, some examples below have been updated to use \texttt{manual} or \texttt{report} instead.
\item
  Some changes to the Harvard (Bath) style cannot be applied automatically
  (e.g.~the update to how standards are referenced), so you may need to update
  your .bib file accordingly.
\end{itemize}

\section{Examples}

The examples below are shown in three parts.
The first, marked with \faBook, shows an extract from the
\href{https://library.bath.ac.uk/referencing/harvard-bath}{\emph{Referencing guide: Harvard Bath}} or
\href{https://library.bath.ac.uk/images/referencing}{\emph{Referencing images}}.
The second, marked with \faCog, shows the reference as formatted by Bib\TeX.
The last shows how the reference was entered in the \texttt{.bib} file.
The bottom right corner shows the source of the example: `RX' indicates the `Reference examples (A-Z)' section of the Guide; `RL' indicates the `Organise a reference list' section of the Guide; `RI' indicates \emph{Referencing images}.

Some examples are highlighted in
\tcbox[colframe=hacked,colback=hacked!5!white,nobeforeafter,size=fbox,tcbox raise base]{orange}.
This indicates that some fields have been `abused' to achieve the right effect;
in other words, they contain information that does not conform with their intended use.
Some others make use of the \texttt{note} and \texttt{titleaddon} fields to achieve
the right effect, where other styles might need the information placed differently.
Particular care should be taken with such items when switching between different styles,
though of course any item might need adjustment to take account of differing conventions.

\begin{hacks}
\item With most styles, you would put `in press' or `preprint' as the
  \texttt{year} for articles that have yet to be officially published, but for
  this style you need to put it in \texttt{volume}. If you would rather lose
  this information when switching to a different style than have it incorrectly
  placed, you can use the \texttt{pubstate} field from \textsf{biblatex}
  instead. Use the keyword \texttt{inpress} for `in press' and
  \texttt{inpreparation} or \texttt{submitted} (whichever is more accurate) for
  `preprint'.

\subsubsection*{Work in a non-Roman alphabet}

\begin{tips}
\item
The following example tricks Bib\TeX\ into treating the original rendering of the author's name as the `von' part of a Roman-alphabet name. This requires the use of a command that simply gobbles its argument, which you have to define yourself:

\begin{tcblisting}{listing only}
\newcommand*{\noop}[1]{}
\end{tcblisting}

For the trick to work, the argument you give to \lstinline[style=dtxlatex]|\noop| must be lowercase, but otherwise it can be anything you like.
\end{tips}
