OVERVIEW
--------
Package xlop proposes two main features.  First, xlop prints
operations (displayed or running), that is, user write only
operands.  Second, xlop is able to deal with unlimited numbers, in
fact, limitations are due to TeX memory.  This features include
basic arithmetic operations, input/ouput, numeric variables, tests,
and some high level operation (without operations which imply infinite
processing such exponential, trigonometric functions, etc.).

DISTRIBUTION
------------
License
-------
All the source files have the license type lppl

Contents
--------
Distribution consists of files:
  * README (the file you are reading)
  * LISEZ.MOI (same in french)
  * history.txt relates project history
  * xlop-doc-fr.tex and xlop-doc-fr.pdf source and pdf of french user's
    manual of xlop
  * xlop-doc.tex and xlop-doc.pdf source and pdf of english user's
    manual of xlop
  * xlop.tex xlop code
  * xlop.sty allow the use of xlop as LaTeX package

Installation
------------
xlop can be used under TeX or LaTeX.  Thus, TDS recommendations are
that the best place to put the file xlop.tex is
  [texmf]/tex/generic/xlop/
and that the best place to put xlop xlop.sty is
  [texmf]/tex/latex/xlop/

For documentation files (README, history.txt, and fr-user.*), best
place should be [texmf]/doc/generic/xlop/.

You have just to run texhash command (or mktexlsr, or ...) to refresh
your texmf base and all should work fine.

BUGS AND TROUBLES
-----------------------------
If you detect some bug, whatever its seriousness (that could be just
spurious spaces), try to illustre this error with an example as short
as possible.  Particularly, don't use unecessary package.  Sent your
code with a short explanation at:

If you wish for some feature in a future version, ask to the author.
