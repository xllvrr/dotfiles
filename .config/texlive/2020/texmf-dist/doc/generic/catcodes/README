               README for the `catcodes' bundle
                   (C) Uwe Lueck 2015/11/14

The `catcodes' bundle deals with category code switching. 
The contained packages should work with LaTeX as well as without 
(based on the `plainpkg' package). The important cases of category 
codes are 
(a) "private letters" for internal package commands and 
(b) active characters. 
`stacklet.sty' deals with (a), `actcodes.sty' with (b). 
There also is 
(c) `catchdq.sty', an application of (b), 
for automatic insertion of typographical double quotes 
when the user only enters ASCII double quotes. What is 
"typographical" differs between languages, the new `langcode' 
package completes `catchdq''s functionality in this respect.

The documentation for the three package files is contained 
in the file `catcodes.pdf'.

REQUIRED PACKAGES: plainpkg, stacklet

RELATED PACKAGES: catoptions, pcatcode (amsrefs), texapi, csquotes

KEYWORDs: macro programming, category codes, private letters, 
    active characters, double quotes

The package files `actcodes.sty', `catchdq.sty', and 
`stacklet.sty', together with the documentation files
`catcodes.pdf' and `catcodes.tex', can be redistributed and/or
modified under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public License;
either version 1.3c of the License, or any later version, see

There is NO WARRANTY, actually all of this still is a little 
experimental.

The `catcodes' bundle is author-maintained in the sense of
the license.

The latest public version of the bundle is available at

    http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/generic/catcodes/

A TDS version of the package is available as

    http://mirror.ctan.org/install/macros/generic/catcodes.tds.zip

The file `catcodes.RLS' summarizes bundle releases. With the 
`typeoutfileinfo' package, the command

    typeoutfileinfo catcodes.RLS

tells which release is installed on your system. Similar packages 
are `ltxfileinfo' by Wybo Dekker and `latexfileversion' by Harald
Harders.
