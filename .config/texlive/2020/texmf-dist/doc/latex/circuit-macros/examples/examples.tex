  This is a collection of diagrams the author has had occasion to produce
  using m4 circuit macros and others, and gpic or dpic.  In some cases
  there are other or better m4 or pic constructs for producing the
  same drawings, but the source-file names are shown for reference.
  Most of the examples can be processed using either dpic~-p, dpic~-g,
  or gpic~-t, but the possibility of other postprocessing has meant that
  sometimes the source is slightly more complicated than it would be if
  only one workflow had been assumed.  Some of the examples require dpic.
  The most simplicity and elegance is achieved by sticking to one pic
  interpreter and one postprocessor.

  This document duplicates a few diagrams from the manual
  Circuit\_macros.pdf.  There are also a few files in the
  examples directory that are not included in this document. To process
  {\sl file}.m4, type, for example, "make {\sl file}.pdf."

% Some of the boundaries of what macros and the pic language can do are
% tested toward the end of the following examples.
