# DOTFILES

Useful configurations contained within repo:

- Code OSS (VS Code for Certain Languages)
- Alacritty
- Fcitx5
- Nvim
- Zsh and its aliases

The unmaintained portions are from a previous bswpm setup that I have decided to not continue using but have become too lazy to remove and see whether it might be needed in the future
